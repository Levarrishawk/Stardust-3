-- Volcano Battlefield HK-47 finale add, a CWW8 Battle Walker summoned at the 20% HP ladder step.
-- Live row som_volcano_final_walker, level 83 ELITE; level here is BOSS tier 120, not live's 83 -- see
-- the note below.
-- Live weapon droid_cww8_01.iff is unregistered, so this falls back to ranged_weapons from
-- cww8_battle_droid.lua. Loot follows that sibling's technician_tier_1 / junk block with no
-- lootChance line.
-- The volcano sits one rung above the valley battlefield on the same tier ladder
-- (scratch/MUSTAFAR-GAPS.md): live BOSS -> APEX 140, live ELITE -> BOSS 120. The valley
-- is Chapter Three task 6 and the volcano is the campaign's last content, gated behind
-- it, so the two cannot sit on the same rung. Live encodes that gap in raw HP -- the
-- volcano bosses run 545k-950k against the valley's numbers -- and the ladder replaces
-- raw HP, so the gap has to move onto the ladder or it disappears. That one-rung shift
-- is the only authored number here; every other field is copied from a tier anchor or
-- from live.
